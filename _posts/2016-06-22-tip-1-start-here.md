# \#1 Get the newest version!

You are in Beta at The Grid, right? Than make sure you know of the latest version of The Grid's control panel before you do anything else.

The Grid is giving access to its beta version AI tool to create websites just by introducing content. The design should be cared for by AI engine working behind.

There was a [first version][0] for the interface that managed content and where you could give some guidance on the kind of website you wanted as a result. But now they have launched [version 2][1]. The tool is still underdevelopment but the interface has changed considerably between versions.

For instance, on this last version if you want to change some of the aspects of the design and and ask for a "Redesing' you will taken to a survey where you score each aspect of the design. If you score low, you will be given the option to chose what you want (colour palette) or some drastic changes will be suggested. Nothing gets done until you republish your website.

Enjoy!
